Hi! 

My name is Austin Fay. I probably didn't need to tell you that though, seeing as this website is called AustinFay.com this page is titled "About Austin Fay." Anyway...

At the time of writing this, I have just graduated high school. So what do you do after you graduate high school? Well you start building your career of course! Most people (including me) start with college. But the thing is... I have a whole summer before the fall semester begins. So, I'll start my career by building this website and starting a YouTube Channel.

But why create this website and channel in the first place? Well, ever since I was about 7 or 8 years old, I've been tinkering around with computers and electronics. I started with HTML, and then I moved on to other types of computer language like Java. Ever since then, I've tinkered and experimented with different kinds things on the computer, and I've built some electronics projects too. I don't have them very well documented, but by creating this website and channel, I hope to remedy that while at the same time sharing this documentation with the world. I hope to share everything I've learned about computers and electronics so that other people can learn.

So if you're interested in computers (or electronics), keep browsing this site. I hope you enjoy the content on here; I'll be spending a lot of time producing it!
