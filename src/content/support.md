## Sharing

One of the simplest ways to support my work is by sharing it with other people. The more people I can reach, the more people I can teach! If you have friends that are also interested in computers, mention my website in your next conversation. I think they'll appreciate it. 

## Donations

The content on this website is quite a bit of work to produce. And guess where some of this knowledge comes from? College! As you probably know, a college education isn't cheap. 

So if you have the means, I ask that you make your contribution to this website by funding my college education. Thanks!
